Coding Conventions
==================

This section describes the coding conventions for the pysiral project.

Code Style
----------

At the minimum, the code should follow the PEP8 style guide and
be documented with docstrings in restructuredText format. 

Python Compability
------------------

The minimum python version since pysiral v0.13 is python 3.10+. 
python ``match/case`` structural pattern matching is allowed.


Software Tests
--------------

The software tests are currently based on the built-in ``unittest`` 
framework. Their purpose is to ensure that the code works as intended
on a technical level, not necessarily scientifically.

.. note ::
    The software tests might be changed to ``pytest`` in the future.


Dependencies
------------

Only well maintained and open python libraries should be used as dependencies.
